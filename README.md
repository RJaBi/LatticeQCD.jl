This code enabales you to perform lattice QCD calculations!

[What is lattice QCD? (PDG)](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2019/reviews/rpp2018-rev-lattice-qcd.pdf)



# Quick start

You can start lattice QCD in 5 steps!



1.Download a Julia binary from [Julialang.org](https://julialang.org/)



2.In Julia REPL, push "]" key to enter the package mode

```
add https://github.com/akio-tomiya/LatticeQCD.jl
```
press "backspace" key ( "delete" key for mac) key to exit the package mode.

(All dependence will be solved automatically)



3.Include the package with

```
using LatticeQCD
```



4.Make a parameter file with wizard,

```
run_wizard()
```

Choose parameters as you want!



5.Start simulation with created your parameter file!

```
 run_LQCD("parameters_used.jl")
```

You'll get results!

Of cource, you can write/modify a parameter file by yourself.

Enjoy life with lattice QCD.



# What is supported?

We support 4 dimensional euclidean spacetime and following things:

- Configuration generation
  - Cold/Hot start for SU(2) and SU(3), One instanton for SU(2)
  - Heatbath for SU(2) and SU(3) for plaquette gauge action
  - HMC for SU(2) and SU(3) for plaquette gauge action
  - <s>Quenched HMC with SU(2) or SU(3) for general gauge actionÂ </s> (This will be supported)
  - HMC (2 flavor Wilson/Clover) with SU(2) or SU(3) for plaquette gauge action
  - HMC (4 flavor Staggered fermions) with SU(2) or SU(3) for plaquette gauge action
  - <s>RHMC (any flavor staggered) with SU(2) or SU(3) for general gauge action</s> (This will be supported)
  - <s> General gauge action = plaquette+rect + etc action </s>  (This will be supported)
  - Fermion integrated HMC with plaquette action
  - Self-learning Monte-Carlo with plaquette action
  - Self-learning HMC with plaquette action
  - Load & measurement mode (load and measure all configurations in a directory)
- Measurements
  - Plaquette
  - Polyakov loop
  - Chiral condensates (Wilson/Staggered)
  - Momentum projected pion correlator (Wilson fermion)
  - <s>Topological charge with the Wilson flow (Clover operaor definition)</s>   (Not well tested)
- I/O for configurations
  - <s>ILDG format</s> (This will be supported)
  - JLD format (Defoult binary file for Julia, one of HDF5)

Many of smearing and improved fermion actions and parallelazation have not supported yet.


# USAGE/User interface

We support following two user interfaces

1. Julia REPL interface (For beginners, just after the lattice QCD textbook)
2. Genral run code (Experience with another code, for batch job, customised purpose)

Usage 1 was already explained. 

For Usage 2, you can clone this repository with Git commands.
And in the directory, you can execute like,

```
julia run.jl PARAMETER_FILE
```

then, you get results though standard I/O. The "PARAMETER_FILE" can be created through the wizard "julia run_wizard.jl"  or you can write by yourself.


# Purpose of the code
We develop this code to achive following things:

1. Good portability (If one has Julia, this code is runnable. All dependence is under control.)
2. Easy to start/ pedagogical (start in 10 minutes)
3. Suite (configuration generation with and without fermions, and measurements)
4. Easy to modify (Good for prototyping)
5. Compatitive speed with Fortran 90 codes

This is the first open source Julia code for lattice QCD. High performance is out of our scope.

# How has it been tested?

We compared results to following papers/codes 

- SU(3) staggered HMC with https://inspirehep.net/literature/283285

# Reference

We refer "Lattice Tool Kit" https://nio-mon.riise.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/LTK/ written in Fortran 90.
